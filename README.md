## My process

### Built with

Nothing fancy here. It's all vanilla.

- HTML
- CSS 

### What I learned

This challenge was the first challenge I didn't need to look anything up. I just knew all of the code that I needed and went into a state of flow. 

This challenge served to solidify what I have already learned. 

### Continued development

Although this challenge was simple and a part of me wants to move on to the junior level stuff, my completionist tendancies cannot be ignored. I'm going to shoot to finish all the newbie challenges. It will be good to solidify the newbie stuff into my brain. After all, programming is a perashible skill; anything I can commit to long term memory is a win.
